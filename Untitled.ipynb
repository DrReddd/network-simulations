    "\n",
    "In its most basic setting a network consists of nodes and edges, and as long as we are only talking about a structure where nodes are connected through edges we can use the terms graph and network interchangeably. \n",
    "\n",
    "First i will introduce the random network from te simulation point of view. The definition follows as: we start with $n$ node, and between each and every pair of nodes we generate an edge with a probability $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method will in fact generate a network, but what can we say about this network? One core concept is the degree distribution of a given network. In this case the appropriate question is: What is the probability, that a given node in the generated network will have exactly k degrees (k other nodes connected to it). According to our model for a given node $N_1$ an other node $N_i$ can connect with probability $p$ and cannot connect with probability $1-p$. This describes a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p$. Since for a given node we have $n-1$ other nodes, our original question translates to summing up $n-1$ i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, which gives us a Binomial random variable with parameters $p$, $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can say something about the expected number of degrees ($\\lambda$) in this network, which is $p*(n-1)$. There is one other discreet distribution we'll have to discuss briefly for the first simulation: The Poisson distribution. In the binomial distribution as $n$ goes to infinity and $p$ goes to 0 we arrive at the Poission ditribution in the limit. In fact if $n>>p$, the probability mass function of the two distribution is virtually the same. Since the only parameter needed to describe a Poission distribution in the case of our network is $\\lambda$, it is easier to work with. We will simulate a random network, and plot its exact distribution of its degrees, and we will comapre it with the theoretic distributions describing it: the binomial and Poission. While for $n>>p$ we should see the same behaviour, when p is becoming larger we should see the difference between the the two distributions, and we'll see which one fits onto the exact distribution of the network.\n",
