    "\n",
    "In its most basic setting a network consists of nodes and edges, and as long as we are only talking about a structure where nodes are connected through edges we can use the terms graph and network interchangeably. \n",
    "\n",
    "First i will introduce the random network from the simulation point of view. The definition follows as: we start with $n$ node, and between each and every pair of nodes we generate an edge with a probability $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method will in fact generate a network, but what can we say about this network? One core concept is the degree distribution of a given network. In this case the appropriate question is: What is the probability, that a given node in the generated network will have exactly k degrees (k other nodes connected to it). According to our model for a given node $N_1$ an other node $N_i$ can connect with probability $p$ and cannot connect with probability $1-p$. This describes a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p$. Since for a given node we have $n-1$ other nodes, our original question translates to summing up $n-1$ i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, which translates to a Binomial random variable with parameters $p$, $n-1$.\n",
    "Now we can say something about the expected number of degrees ($\\lambda$) in this network, which is $p(n-1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one other discreet distribution we'll have to discuss briefly for the first simulation: The Poisson distribution. In the binomial distribution as $n$ goes to infinity and $p$ goes to 0 we arrive at the Poission ditribution in the limit. In fact if $n>>p$, the probability mass function of the two distribution is virtually the same. \n",
    "Since the only parameter needed to describe a Poission distribution in the case of our network is $\\lambda$ (the same $\\lambda$ which gives the expected number of degrees in the binomial distribution. Since the expected number of degrees in a Poission distributed network is the same as the parameter, which is $\\lambda$, this leads two the same expected nuber of degrees in the two distributions.), it is easier to work with. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will simulate a random network, and plot its exact distribution of its degrees, and we will comapre it with the theoretic distributions describing it: the Binomial and Poission. While for $n>>p$ we should see the same behaviour, when p is becoming larger we should see the difference between the the two distributions, and we'll see which one fits onto the exact distribution of the network.\n",

    "Now that we saw how random networks behave, we will turn to another method to generate networks. In this model we start with a given network, possibly with an empty node, and in every turn we will add a new node, which makes $m$ connections. The probability of a new node connecting to an existing node will be linearly dependent of the degrees of the existing nodes. This models a mechanism, where each new node prefers to connect to nodes, which have more neighbours. This preferential attachment translates to many real-world networks, for example the Internet: webpages, that are already linked to by many other pages have more chance to be linked by a new page, just because they are much easier to find.\n",

If we start from an empty node, it is easy to see, that generating a network with $n$ total nodes, and $m=1$ will lead to a network, where the number of total edges is exactly $n$.

The term scale-free comes from the fact, that from a scale-free network a randomly chosen node's number of degrees can strongly differ from the expected number of degrees. Mathematically this can be seen from analysing how the second moment of a power-law distribution behaves, when the size of the network can be arbitrarily large.\n",
